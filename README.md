# ML-for-BPD
Use Machine Learning models to predict Bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) in premature infants.

You can use:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Gradient Boosting Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine

The data used for my experiment were obtained from a subset of the VON database (https://public.vtoxford.org/), avaiable only for members.
